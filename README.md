# Sources for openly licensed images of manuscripts  #

The file [`sources.md`](https://github.com/neelsmith/mssimgs/blob/master/sources.csv) in this repository lists sources for photography of manuscripts licensed for scholarly use.  All the sources listed use licenses permitting their images to be reused and redistributed for non-commercial purposes, and require attribution of the image to the original source. 

The list includes sources with extensive or complete coverage of one or more manuscripts, but not sources that include only isolated individual manuscript pages.
