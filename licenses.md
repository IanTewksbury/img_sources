Licensing of digital scholarly resources must permit:

- reusing the resource to replicate and verify prior work
- reusing the resource to extend and build upon prior work
- sharing resources with others so that they, too, can reuse them

The [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) project (CC) is a reliable place to find licenses that satisfy these conditions and have been thoroughly vetted by legal professionals.  Examples of CC licenses that satisfy the requirements of scholarship include the Creative Commons [Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) (CC BY-NC-SA) license.
