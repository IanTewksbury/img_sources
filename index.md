title: Sources for openly licensed images of manuscripts

## About this project

To enable the central scholarly activities of review and replication of previous work, digital resources must be available under [appropriate licenses](licenses).  Digital paleography depends ultimately on digital images of manuscripts, papyri or other documents, so these images must be licensed for scholarly reuse.  While there are numerous collections of links to on-line images of manuscripts on the web, I know of no list that limits itself to images suitable for scholarly reuse.  We are assembling a list of sources for openly-licensed images of manuscripts in [this github repository](https://github.com/openpaleography/img_sources).

## How you can contribute ##

Submit other sources for openly-licensed images!  If you are a github user, you may directly edit a clone of the `sources.md` table and submit a pull request.  If you prefer, you may simply send an email to user `nsmith` at the email domain `holycross.edu`.
